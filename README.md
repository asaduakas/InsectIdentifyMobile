## IGB Institute Insect Identification Software (Mobile Version)

Artificial Light at Night (ALAN), or light pollution, is
increasingly prominent in modern society. Many
scientists suspect that ALAN is a cause of the decline of
the insect population. To understand it further, it is
necessary to acquire data on the specific insects attracted to the streetlights. Working with the Leibniz-
Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries
(IGB), we created a dichotomous key for insect
identification. Using this key, we developed an
interactive mobile and desktop application for citizen
scientists. We then conducted three rounds of user
testing to improve upon the accuracy and efficiency of
both the dichotomous key and the applications.
Afterwards, we integrated a data entry feature for the
professional scientists to digitize and simplify their entry
process. Using our applications, the AuBe project at the
IGB will be able to identify insect orders much more
efficiently, thereby collecting more of the necessary
data. This data will enable scientists to conduct a
comparative study to test their hypothesis about the
relative importance of ALAN to insect health.
